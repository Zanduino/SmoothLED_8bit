@mainpage Arduino Library Header to use 8-bit PWM on any pin

@section Smooth_LED_intro_section Description

Hardware PWM on the Atmel ATMega microprocessors can only be done on certain pins, and these are
attached to specific timers. This library allows doing 8-bit PWM with 256 levels on any pin,
regardless of whether they support hardware PWM or not. By default, if the pin can support hardware
PWM this library will use, although that can be disabled during the begin() call.

Since the PWM is done in software, it "steals" CPU cycles from the main sketch and the more LEDs
defined in the library the more CPU cycles it consumes.

User documentation is located at https://github.com/Zanduino/SmoothLED_8bit/wiki

@section Smooth_LED_doxygen Doxyygen configuration
This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/SmoothLED_8bit/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
Edit this file and set the 5 variables: PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF and
PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation. The local copy of the
doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local doxygen testing, but the
file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

@section Smooth_LEDclang clang-format
Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
committing and uploading.

/*! @brief   Linear PWM brightness progression table using CIE brightness levels
    @details CIE 1931 color space and PWM. Fading a LED with PWM from 255 to 0 linearly will not
             result in a visually linear fade due to the way our eyes work. Setting PWM to half
             strength (50% duty cycle) actually looks much brighter than it should.  The formula for
             lightness uses floating point and cubes so is not fast enough for an Arduino to compute
             on the fly at runtime. Hence a table is used for the lookup, but this comes at a price
             of 256Bytes of memory which is a pretty significant amount of memory for a small micro-
             processor.  CIE mode is turned on by default in this library, but if the following
             "#define CIE_MODE" is commented out the library will shrink by over 2kB in size and the
             dimming / fading will no longer have CIE adjustments applied.
             The kcie table was generated using a program written by Jared Sanson and explained on
             https://jared.geek.nz/2013/feb/linear-led-pwm. */
